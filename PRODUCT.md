## Platform

web

## Stack

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, static export, GSAP for motion. Chosen by the
user from a stack question offering plain static HTML/CSS, Next.js, or Astro.
No CMS. All editable content lives in one file so a non-developer can update it.

## Users

Two audiences arrive on the same page, both from a phone, both in under a minute:

1. **Brussels diners who have not heard of KERA** — sent by a friend, an
   Instagram story, or a passing sign on Rue Saint-Quentin. They are deciding
   whether this is worth waiting for. They know little to nothing about Georgian
   food; "Georgian" may even read as ambiguous to them.
2. **People already following the build-out** — returning to see progress and to
   find out when they can finally book a table.

Neither can eat here yet. The site's job is to convert interest into a follow,
and to hold that interest until opening.

## Product Purpose

KERA is a Georgian restaurant under construction in Brussels, opening autumn
2026. This is its pre-opening single-page site. Success is a visitor who
understands what Georgian hospitality is, believes this particular room will be
worth the trip, and leaves connected — Instagram follow first, email second — so
KERA can reach them on opening day.

It is explicitly *not* a menu site or a booking site yet. It must not pretend to
be either.

## Positioning

"Kera" (ქერა) is the Georgian hearth — the fire at the centre of the home where
people gather, stories are told, and food is made. The name is the entire
argument: the restaurant is not selling dishes, it is selling the supra, the
Georgian table. Modern Georgian cooking rooted in Caucasus tradition, with a
selected set of Azerbaijani specialities alongside it — a combination no
neighbouring Brussels restaurant can truthfully claim.

The pre-opening moment is itself an asset, not an apology: the visitor is
invited into the building of the place, not made to wait outside it.

## Operating Context

- Read overwhelmingly on phones, in a few seconds, often from an Instagram link.
- Brussels: multilingual, dense with restaurants, sceptical of hype. The
  European Quarter around Rue Saint-Quentin is offices by day, residential by
  evening.
- The physical venue is confirmed: two dining halls, a private VIP room, a
  terrace, and a veranda.
- Progress is being documented daily on Instagram stories — that channel is
  live now, the restaurant is not.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- **English only**, confirmed by the user. No FR/NL versions in this build.
- Single page, anchor navigation, no sub-pages, no CMS, no backend.
- **Confirmed facts:** address Rue Saint-Quentin 29, Brussels, Belgium;
  Instagram `@kera_brussels`; opening autumn 2026; two dining halls, VIP room,
  terrace, veranda.
- **Not yet known — must not be invented:** phone number, email address,
  opening hours, chef or team names, exact opening date. The user intended to
  supply phone and email and did not; the page treats both as pending rather
  than guessing.
- **The menu is a labelled placeholder.** On the user's explicit instruction the
  site carries a full sample menu — six categories, invented dishes, invented
  euro prices — so the layout can be seen and judged. It is not the kitchen's
  menu and does not claim to be: `menu.draft` in `content/site.ts` prints the
  disclaimer above the tabs, and removing the flag without replacing the
  contents is the one way this section could become a lie.
- Email capture is a stated want; no form backend exists yet, so the markup must
  leave a clean, documented hook rather than a dead form.

## Brand Commitments

- Name **KERA**, from the Georgian hearth. The meaning is the story and must be
  told on the page.
- Voice from the user's own copy: warm, first-person plural, direct, unhurried.
  "Welcome Home. Welcome to KERA." Fire and hearth are the recurring images.
- The user's supplied copy (`text.md`) is the source of truth for what the page
  says; it may be enhanced and extended, not contradicted.
- Structural reference: brocnbroll.be — single page, anchor nav.
- Motion reference: gsap-cocktail-showcase.surge.sh — cinematic scroll-driven
  animation, large display typography, moving text.

## Evidence on Hand

- `text.md` — the founder's own announcement copy, 19 lines.
- `images/` — four licensed-unknown photographs used as *mood* reference:
  Svaneti stone towers under snow peaks, a supra table laid above a green
  valley, a mountain church at sunrise with a full table in the foreground, a
  church on a ridge under the Caucasus. They depict Georgia, not the restaurant.
- **There are no photographs of KERA itself** — the room does not exist yet.
  The site must never present a stock or reference image as the venue.
- No testimonials, no press, no reviews, no awards. None may be fabricated.

## Product Principles

1. **The hearth is the argument.** Every section should trace back to fire,
   gathering, and the table — not to food photography clichés.
2. **Honest about what does not exist yet.** Unknown facts are shown as
   deliberately pending, never guessed. An empty state designed with care reads
   as confidence; a fabricated one destroys it.
3. **Teach Georgia in passing.** Most visitors do not know khachapuri, supra, or
   tamada. Introduce them inside the experience, never in a lecture.
4. **The build-out is the content.** Being unfinished is the story worth
   following; the page should make a visitor want to watch it happen.
5. **One action.** Follow on Instagram. Everything else is subordinate.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Phone-first, one-handed. All scroll-driven motion must have a static, complete
fallback: `prefers-reduced-motion` and no-JavaScript visitors get the finished
page, never an empty one. Georgian script appears as accent, always paired with
a Latin reading.
